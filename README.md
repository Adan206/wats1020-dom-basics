In this assignment students explore the native tools provided in Javascript to navigate and affect the DOM.

 PLAN: Assignment contains a simple HTML/css setup with several areas where data should be that are empty. Students have to write Javascript that is loaded at the end of the file to fill in the blank spots with information provided in an Array. This is a simple simulation of getting data from an API and dumping it into the page, and introduces the basics of finding elements in the DOM and adding information into them. This uses all raw Javascript methods.
